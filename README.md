Uptm (short for Uptime) &mdash; is a platform for web developers and website owners. There are two core features (and more to come) such as [***Website Monitoring***](#website-monitoring) and [**Automated Builds**](#continuous-integration) for Continuous Integration (CI).

## Website Monitoring

Everyone knows that any website can accidentally go down.
It might be caused by a web server or a code error or by any other reason.
It is always better when you as the website owner get notified about that sooner than your visitors.

[Uptm.io](https://uptm.io?utm_source=docs) is here to help you keep your websites up and running.

### How does it work
We monitor your website periodically and check if it is up or down and immediately notify you when an accident happens.

### What kind of resources can be monitored?
Everything that might be seen by HTTP protocol at the moment &mdash; Websites, APIs. More types of monitors to be released soon.

### How to create a Monitor for my Website?

First you'll have to [create an account](https://login.uptm.io/signup?utm_source=docs) to let us know your email we will send the alerts to.
Then [Sign In](https://login.uptm.io/signin?utm_source=docs) and you'll see the **Dashboard**.

Navigate to **Monitors** and click **Add**.
You'll see the form with protocol, URL (or IP), monitor name and the frequency fields.
In this example frequency _5 min_ means that we're going to check the website availability every 5 minutes.

Then click **Add** and you'll be navigated to the **Monitors** index where you can see the card of your just created monitor.
