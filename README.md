Uptm (short for Uptime) &mdash; is a platform for web developers and website owners. There are two core features (and more to come) such as [***Website Monitoring***](#website-monitoring) and [**Automated Builds**](#continuous-integration) for Continuous Integration (CI).

## Website Monitoring

Everyone knows that any website can accidentally go down. It might be caused by a web server or a code error or by any other reason. It is always better when you as the website owner will be notified about that sooner than your visitors.

Uptm.io is here to help you keep your websites up and running.

### How does it work
We monitor your website periodically and check if it is up or down and immediately notify you when an accident happens.

### What kind of resources can be monitored?
Everything that might be seen by HTTP protocol at the moment &mdash; Websites, APIs. More types of monitors to be released soon.

### How to create a Monitor for my Website?

First you'll have to [create an account](https://login.uptm.io/signup) to let us know your email we will send the alerts to. Then [Sign In](https://login.uptm.io/signin) and you'll see the **Dashboard**.

Navigate to **Monitors** and click **Add**.
You'll see the form with protocol, URL (or IP), monitor name and the frequency fields.

Then click **Add** and you'll be navigated to the Monitors index where you should see the card of your just created monitor.
